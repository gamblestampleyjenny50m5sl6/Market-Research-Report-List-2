<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Free Scroll Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Scroll</li><li>Orbiting Scroll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil free scroll compressors can be divided into two main types: fixed scroll and orbiting scroll. </p><p>In fixed scroll compressors, one scroll remains stationary while the other moves in a circular motion, creating compression between the two scrolls. This design is simpler and quieter, making it ideal for smaller applications.</p><p>On the other hand, orbiting scroll compressors have both scrolls moving in a circular motion, allowing for higher efficiency and better performance in larger applications. Overall, both types offer oil-free operation and reliable performance in various industries.</p></p>
