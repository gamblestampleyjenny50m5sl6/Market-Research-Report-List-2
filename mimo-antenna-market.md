<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MIMO Antenna Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Type</li><li>Compact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Normal type MIMO antennas are usually larger in size and have multiple antenna elements, which are spaced apart at certain distances to achieve diversity in signal propagation. These antennas are ideal for applications where space is not a constraint. On the other hand, compact MIMO antennas are smaller in size and are designed to fit into tight spaces, making them suitable for devices with limited space availability. Both types of antennas provide improved signal coverage, reliability, and data throughput in wireless communication systems.</p></p>
