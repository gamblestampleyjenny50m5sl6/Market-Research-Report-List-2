<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2 Phase Stepper Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar Type</li><li>Unipolar Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>2 Phase stepper motors are divided into two main types - bipolar and unipolar. Bipolar stepper motors have only 4 wires and require a reversing of current flow to change the direction of rotation. They offer higher torque output and are commonly used in industrial automation. On the other hand, unipolar stepper motors have 5 or 6 wires and can be controlled in a more straightforward manner. They are often used in less demanding applications such as consumer electronics.</p></p>
