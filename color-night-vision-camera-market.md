<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color Night Vision Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Cameras</li><li>PTZ Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Color night vision cameras come in two main types: fixed cameras and PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras. Fixed cameras are stationary and provide a stable viewing angle. They are suitable for monitoring specific areas continuously. On the other hand, PTZ cameras offer the flexibility to pan, tilt, and zoom to capture different angles and focus on specific areas of interest. This makes them ideal for surveillance in larger spaces where operators need to actively control the camera's movement. Both types play a crucial role in the color night vision camera market.</p></p>
